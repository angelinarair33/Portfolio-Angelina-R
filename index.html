                    Here is a picture of me! My name is Angelina Richardson, and it is nice to meet you! I was born in Japan, and moved to the United States with my parents when I was two years old. Another thing about me is I have a dog named Louie and a ferret named Goose. My favorite animal is a raccoon, and I have a colorful tattoo of a raccoon holding a knife on my thigh. My favorite movie is "The Fifth Element."
